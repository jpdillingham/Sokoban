# Sokoban
A Sokoban game written in VB6, made in 2002.

## Setup
An error involving comdlg32.ocx will most likely be raised when attempting to run the application.  This is normal and expected, and occurs because of the way the Visual Basic 6 runtime files were distributed.

If this occurs, follow the directions [here](http://windowsxp.mvps.org/comdlg32.htm).
